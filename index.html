                <h3> WHAT IS BIODIVERSITY?</h3>
                <p>Biodiversity is all the different kinds of life we’ll find in one area—the variety of animals,
                    plants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world. Each of these
                    species and organisms work together in ecosystems, like an intricate web, to maintain balance and
                    support life. Biodiversity supports everything in nature that we need to survive: food, clean water,
                    medicine, and shelter.Usually three levels of biodiversity are discussed—genetic, species, and
                    ecosystem diversity.</p>

            <div class="genetic">
                <h3>» GENETIC DIVERSITY</h3>
                <p>Genetic diversity is all the different genes contained in all individual
                    plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms. It occurs within a species as
                    well as between species.</p>

                <h3>What are the Threats to Biodiversity?</h3>
                <p>The loss of biodiversity is a significant issue for scientists and policy-makers and the topic is
                    finding its way
                    into living rooms and classrooms. Species are becoming extinct at the fastest rate known in
                    geological history
                    and most of these extinctions have been tied to human activity.</p>

                <div class="Habitatlossanddestruction">
                    <h3>• Habitat loss and destruction</h3>
                    <p>Habitat loss and destruction, usually as a direct result of human activity and population growth,
                        is a
                        major force in the loss of species, populations, and ecosystems.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="Alterations">
                    <h3> • Alterations in ecosystem composition</h3>
                    <p>Alterations in ecosystem composition, such as the loss or decline of a species, can lead to a
                        loss of
                        biodiversity. For example, efforts to eliminate coyotes in the canyons of southern California
                        are linked to
                        decreases in song bird populations in the area. As coyote populations were reduced, the
                        populations of
                        their prey, primarily raccoons, increased. Since raccoons eat bird eggs, fewer coyotes led to
                        more
                        raccoons eating more eggs, resulting in fewer song birds.</p>

                    <h3>• The introduction of exotic (non-native) species </h3>
                    <p>The introduction of exotic (non-native) species can disrupt entire
                        ecosystems and impact populations of native plants or animals. These invaders
                        can adversely affect native species by eating them, infecting them, competing
                        with them, or mating with them.</p>

                    <p>Habitat conservation is important in maintaining biodiversity, an essential part of global food
                        security. There is evidence to support a trend of accelerating erosion of the genetic resources
                        of agricultural plants and animals.Habitat conservation is a management practice that seeks to
                        conserve, protect and restore habitats and prevent species extinction, fragmentation or
                        reduction in range.</p>
